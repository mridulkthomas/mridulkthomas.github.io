      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an ecologist working at the Dept. F.-A. Forel for Environmental and Aquatic Sciences of the University of Geneva. My research interests lie in community and population ecology. I study patterns in ecological communities to understand how species' competitive strategies are shaped by their environment and by evolutionary constraints. Understanding communities from the perspective of strategies/traits allows us to better understand the fundamental forces shaping communities. And with major environmental changes underway, I believe that this is the most promising approach to understand what future ecosystems will look like.</p>
      <p>To this end, I study how phytoplankton traits change across space and time - from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and on time scales ranging from hours to decades. I try to identify and explain ecological patterns with a combination of statistical &amp; machine learning tools, and subsequently use theoretical models to explore how a changing environment may influence them.</p>
